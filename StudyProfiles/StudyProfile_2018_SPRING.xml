                <details>My principal research interests lie in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian and kernel learning methods. I am most interested in theoretical issues and algorthms with a direct impact in the practical application of machine learning techniques, including topics such as feature selection, model selection, performance estimation, model comparison, covariate shift, dealing with imbalanced or "non-standard" data and semi-supervised learning. Most of my applied work centres on problems arising in computational biology, in collaboration with the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy (CAP) and with the nearby John Iness Centre (JIC) and Institute for Food Reasearch (IFR). However I also have long-standing research links with the School of Environmental Sciences (ENV) and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), working on applications of machine learning in the environmental sciences, particularly on modelling and exploiting predictive uncertainty.</details>

D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Twente in the Netherlands with a special focus on computational intelligence in Software Engineering. Joost has held positions in leading Software Engineering research groups across Europe, such as the École des Mines and the University of Lancaster, where he has worked in international research projects. In 2008 Joost was awarded a prestigious Marie Curie Intra-European fellowship from the EU for his work on Software Product Line development. Within the School of Computing Sciences Joost is responsible for the Software Engineering aspect of the teaching curriculum. He has been responsible for the complete redesign of the Software Engineering modules and bringing them up to date with state of the art in industrial software design and academic research. His modules focus on providing students with the fundamental skills for software development, such as object-orientation, and agile and test-driven development, combined with research-led topics and novel developments in industry such as mobile applications and software product lines. The long-standing research interest of Joost is in decision support for modelling and analysing design information during the development of software systems. This includes questions such as: is it possible to reconstruct software designs from partial documentation? How can you optimise the quality and extensibility of software systems when faced with uncertain change scenarios? Can historical data of software projects be used to steer the design of new systems? Most of Joost's research has resulted in advanced modelling techniques for capturing and reasoning with imprecise and uncertain design information based on probability and fuzzy set theory that support software development activities. Joost has over 14 years experience in Software Engineering both from an academic and industrial perspective. He has founded a successful web development company as a student and he has developed software in collaboration with multi-national companies. In his spare time Joost is exploring the application of Software Engineering principles to mobile games development practice. Currently Joost is involved in a variety of Software Engineering activities both related to research and teaching and he is happy to be approached for projects in these areas. He is also available for consultancy, advice and assessment in the field of industrial software engineering.</details>
